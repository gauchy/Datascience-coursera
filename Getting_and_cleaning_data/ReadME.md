#Get and Clean Data project
The project contains two script files
1. run_analysis.R
2. run_analysis_functions.R

run_analysis.R contains all the steps for cleaning the data , 
it uses run_analysis_functions.R for the following functions
- extractMeanSD
- applyPrettyNames

**extractMeanSD** extracts the mean and sd columns .it checks for mean() or sd() occurances in the names of the dataset and extracts them.
**applyPrettyNames** creates descriptive name for the columns.Descriptive names are generated by following steps-
- for mean() name it Mean_of_
- for sd() name it SD_of_
- for X,Y,Z name it X_of_,Y_of_,Z_of_
- for Mag name it Euclidean_norm_of_
- for Jerk name it Jerk_obtained_from_
- for starting with t name it Butterworth_filtered_
- for starting with f name it Fast_fourier_transformed_
- for BodyBody name it Body_Body_
- for Body name it Body_
- for Gravity name it Gravity_
- for Acc name it Acceleration
- for Gyro name it Angular_velocity

Thus a name tBodyAcc-mean()-X gets transformed to Mean_of_X_of_Butterworth_filtered_Body_Acceleration

**run_analysis.R**The following steps are used in the analysis of the data-
- Read dataset
- apply column names read from features.txt
- Extract mean() and sd() from the dataset
- merge all test data i.e. X_test.txt , y_test.txt and subject_test.txt
- merge all training data i.e. X_train.txt , y_train.txt and subject_train.txt
- merge test and training data
- apply activity labels
- apply descriptive names
- take averages
- write to file


**Note** : To run run_analysis() ,set working directory to the repository directory.
Extracted "UCI HAR Dataset" should be present in the cloned repository location.
